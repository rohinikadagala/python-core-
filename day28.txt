infinite while loop:
-------------------
	syntax
	------
	while condition:
		stmt_1
		stmt_2
		......
		stmt_n

	ref fig: infinite while loopflowchart



infinite while loop means the while condition is always True.

note:
-----
	0,0.0,0j,0+0j,0.0+0.0j,0+0.0j,0.0+0j	--> False

	except zero's				--> True

ex1:
---
while True:
    print("hai")

output:
------
hai
hai
hai
hai
hai
....
...., keep on executeing upto sufficient memory

ex2:
----
while 1:
    print("hai")


output:
------
hai
hai
hai
hai
hai
....
...., keep on executeing upto sufficient memory

ex3:
----
while 9:
    print("hai")


output:
------
hai
hai
hai
hai
hai
....
...., keep on executeing upto sufficient memory


ex4:

while "siva":
    print("hai")

output:
------

Jumping/Transform statements:
-----------------------------
the python supported jumping/transform statements are,

	1).break
	2).continue
	3).pass

break statement:
-----------------
the "break" statement is a keyword in python,which is used in the looping statements.

if we want to exit from the loop execution at the time of middle of the loop execution,in that case we are using "break" statement.

once the control reach the "break" statement then immediately the control will goto outside the loop.

ex1:
----
i=0
while True:
    print("hai",i)
    if i==3:
        break
    i+=1
print("bye")

output:
-------
hai 0
hai 1
hai 2
hai 3
bye


continue statement:
------------------
the "continue" statement is a keyword in python, which is used in the looping statements.

if we want to skip the execution of one particular iteration, in that case we are using "continue" statement.

ex:
---
i=0
while i<5:
    i+=1
    if i==3:
        continue
    print("hai",i)
print("bye")

output:
-------
hai 1
hai 2
hai 4
hai 5
bye

ex:
---
u_c=p_c=0
while True:
    uname=input("enter your user name: ")
    if uname=='siva':
        while True:
            pwd=input("enter your password: ")
            if pwd=='krish@123':
                break
            else:
                p_c+=1
                if p_c==3:
                    break
                else:
                    print("Invalid Password")
                    print("You have only %d attempts left"%(3-p_c))
                    continue
        break
                    
    else:
        u_c+=1
        if u_c==3:
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid User Name")
            print("You have only %d attempts left"%(3-u_c))
            continue
if uname=='siva':
    if pwd=='krish@123':
        print("successfully login")
    else:
        print("Sorry,You are enter 3-time's wrong password,please try again\
 after 24 hours")
else:
    print("Sorry,You are enter 3-time's wrong user name,please try again\
 after 24 hours")
        
output1:
--------
enter your user name: abc
Invalid User Name
You have only 2 attempts left
enter your user name: pqr
Invalid User Name
You have only 1 attempts left
enter your user name: xyz
Sorry,You are enter 3-time's wrong user name,please try again after 24 hours

output2:
--------
enter your user name: abc
Invalid User Name
You have only 2 attempts left
enter your user name: siva
enter your password: krishna
Invalid Password
